# NoteTakingAppDemo
This is a simple practicing demo for a note taking application. In this application a Restfull CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API is building with Node.js, Express and MongoDB. In version 2 of this application, front end building with React.js would be added.

## Motivation
I develop this appliation as a practical way to enhance my knowlodge about Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React and Restful API.
